# Mindset Makeover Website - CI Project 1

**Mindset Makeover** is a made-up personal coaching website. It's part of a project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development. The main character of this project is Alex Richards. He's like a personal coach. His life story is full of challenges. But he chose to change his life. He did this by transforming how he thinks and deals with problems. This significant change helped him a lot. So, he started Mindset Makeover. This website is for assisting people to change their life stories like he did.

- **Business Objectives**: The primary goal is to establish Mindset Makeover as a leading resource in personal development and coaching. This includes building brand recognition, engaging users through webinars and newsletters, and ultimately creating a platform where users can find valuable, life-changing content.
  
#### Scope

- **Information Architecture**: Content will be organized logically with clear headings and categories. A straightforward menu and clear CTAs (Call to Actions) will guide users through their journey on the site.

#### Skeleton

- **Navigation Design**: A clear and consistent navigation menu will be present on all pages. Key sections will be accessible from the homepage.
- **Interface Design**: The user interface will be clean and uncluttered, with a focus on readability and easy access to information. Important elements like subscription forms and contact details will be prominently displayed.

- **Imagery**: High-quality images that resonate with the theme of personal growth and positivity will be used to engage users visually.

### Wireframes

Creating wireframes was crucial for developing Mindset Makeover. I chose Figma for this task because it's user-friendly and practical. I used real text instead of placeholders in the wireframes, making them more detailed and reflective of the final site.

**Key Aspects of Wireframing**:

- **Layout Visualization**: Using Figma, I was able to quickly visualize the site's layout, ensuring it was easy to navigate.
- **Responsive Design**: I made wireframes for both desktop and mobile devices to guarantee a good user experience on any screen.
- **Real Content Integration**: Including real text in the wireframes gave me a clearer view of the final look and functionality of the site.

Figma was a great help in streamlining my design process, allowing me to focus on the user experience right from the start.

## Design

### Colours Scheme

In the design of the Mindset Makeover website, I carefully selected a colour palette of red, blue, and neutral grey to enhance the user experience and visual appeal.

**Red**, as the primary colour, is strategically used for main call-to-action buttons, links, and icons. It also serves as a background for testimonials, breaking the visual monotony and drawing attention. This vibrant colour symbolizes energy and action, aligning with the site's objective of motivating personal growth.

**Blue** is utilized for headings, darker background elements, and secondary buttons. Its calm and stable nature complements the red, providing a sense of tranquillity and trust, essential for a personal development website.

Additionally, **neutral grey** plays a subtle but crucial role. It is used for very light backgrounds, offering a clean, modern look that enhances readability. For the copyright section, a darker shade of grey provides a sophisticated contrast, grounding the site's design.

Together, these colours create a balanced and engaging visual experience. The combination of red and blue aligns with the website's core themes, while the grey adds a necessary balance, ensuring the design remains accessible and pleasing to the eye.

![Mindset  Makeover Colours](./docs/mindset-makeover-colours.jpg "Mindset  Makeover Colours")

### Fonts

For this project, I chose the Poppins font. Poppins is a geometric sans-serif font known for its modern and clean appearance. Its sleek lines and readable characters make it a popular choice for digital platforms.

**Why Poppins is a good choice**:

1. **Readability**: Poppins offers excellent readability across different devices and screen sizes, which is crucial for ensuring that the website's content is easily digestible by the audience.
2. **Modern Feel**: The contemporary and uncluttered look of Poppins aligns well with the modern and professional aesthetic of the Mindset Makeover website.
3. **Versatility**: Poppins works well in various contexts, from headings and menus to body text, providing a cohesive visual experience throughout the site.
4. **Friendly Appearance**: Despite its clean geometry, Poppins has a friendly quality that makes the website feel approachable and engaging, aligning with the supportive and motivating nature of Mindset Makeover.

![Poppins 300](./docs/poppins-300.jpg "Poppins 300")
![Poppins 800](./docs/poppins-800.jpg "Poppins 800")

In summary, Poppins not only enhances the website’s visual appeal but also supports its functional and emotional objectives, making it an ideal choice for this project.

### Visuals

#### Logo

I brainstormed the initial design ideas for the logo using Midjourney, which helped generate a range of creative concepts. I then used Adobe Illustrator to refine my favourite concept into the final design. This process allowed me to create a logo that's clear and impactful and truly represents the ethos of the brand.

![Logo](./docs/logo.png "Logo")

#### Images

For the specific images needed in the project, like the headshots of Alex Richards, I turned to Midjourney to create the initial versions. These AI-generated images provided a solid starting point. I then used Adobe Photoshop to refine these images further, enhancing their quality to ensure they seamlessly fit the website's overall aesthetic.

#### Icons

I sketched the website's icons by hand on a tablet. I wanted them to have an organic, hand-drawn look to add a unique and personal touch to the site. After completing the sketches, I digitized and vectorized them using Adobe Illustrator. This approach ensured the icons maintained their organic aesthetic and remained visually sharp and effective.

![Icons](./docs/icons.png "Icons")

## Pages and Features

### Website Header Design

I designed the header to blend a classic layout with interactive elements, creating an experience that's both user-friendly and visually appealing.

I designed the header following a standard pattern, with the logo on the left for brand recognition and the navigation menu on the right for a balanced and intuitive layout.

For each menu item, I included an active page indicator, shown as a light red dot, to give a clear visual cue of the user's current location on the site.

I added a hover effect where the underline beneath the menu items expands from left to right. This animation provides lively feedback as users interact with the menu, enhancing their overall experience.

On mobile devices, I replaced the standard menu with a hamburger icon to better suit smaller screens and improve user interaction.

![Header](./docs/header.png "Header")

### Website Footer Design

In my design for the website's footer, I aimed for simplicity and clarity to enhance the user experience.

**Footer Content and Layout**:

- I split the footer into two sections: on the left are secondary links like Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Contact; on the right are links to our social media profiles.
- For mobile users, I made these links stack in a centered column format, making them easy to navigate.
- I chose a dark blue background for this section to subtly contrast with the main content, with the links in light red for a splash of colour and better visibility.

**Colour Scheme**:

- The dark blue background of the footer contrasts with the light red links, ensuring they are easy to read and visually appealing.
- The copyright section is in a dark gray, almost black, offering a clear distinction from the main footer section, with light text for a sharp contrast.

**Newsletter Signup Form**:

- In the footer of the Home and About pages, I added a newsletter signup form, an important feature for engaging users.
- The form has a slightly lighter blue background than the rest of the footer, with white text, making it stand out and inviting users to subscribe.
- I left this form off other pages like Webinar and Contact to keep the user's focus on specific actions, like signing up for the webinar.

![Footer](./docs/footer.png "Footer")

### Home Page

In the Mindset Makeover website project, each section of the home page was designed for optimal engagement and clarity.

The hero section begins with a compelling statement, "Rewire your mind, transform your life," introducing visitors to the concept of personal transformation through Alex's story. This area is set against a light grey background, complemented by a smooth SVG divider that seamlessly transitions to the next part.

![Home Hero](./docs/home-hero.png "Home Hero")

The webinar details section emphasizes the role of mindset in achieving life goals, presenting this through visually engaging icon-text elements that cover themes like positive thinking and goal-setting.

![Home Webinar](./docs/home-webinar.png "Home Webinar")

In the 'About Alex' section, the narrative focuses on his journey of overcoming life's hurdles, structured for readability and emotional connection with the audience.

![Home Alex](./docs/home-alex.png "Home Alex")

Following this, a standout call-to-action for the webinar sign-up is strategically placed to attract attention, leading visitors towards participation. 

![Home CTA](./docs/home-cta.png "Home CTA")

The page concludes with a newsletter signup section, distinct in design yet cohesive with the page's overall aesthetic.

### Webinar Page

In the Mindset Makeover website project, the Webinar Page is structured to provide comprehensive information about the webinar in an engaging manner.

Hero section features an inviting heading and introductory text, setting the stage for what the webinar offers. I've included a custom video teaser that adheres to the site's colour scheme, providing a visual and engaging preview of the webinar.

Between the hero and the next sections, I have added three boxes with details about the webinar, each accompanied by custom icons. 

The agenda is laid out in a straightforward manner, with simple text. This section breaks down the webinar's content, making it easy for visitors to understand what topics will be covered.

A brief section about Alex, the webinar host, includes a photo. This part is concise, offering a quick introduction to Alex and his credentials.

The FAQs are presented in a two-column list, addressing common questions and concerns about the webinar. This format makes it easy for visitors to find answers quickly.

Three testimonials are included to provide insights from previous participants, adding credibility and a personal touch to the webinar.

The page concludes with a webinar signup section, placed before the footer. This final call-to-action is designed to encourage visitors to register for the webinar.

Overall, the Webinar Page of this project is crafted to inform and motivate visitors, guiding them through the details and leading them towards signing up for the webinar.

![Webinar Page](./docs/page-webinar.jpg "Webinar Page")

### About Page

In the Mindset Makeover website project, the About page is created with simplicity and clarity in mind, focusing on introducing Alex and the webinar.

The hero section features a brief introduction about Alex, accompanied by his photo. This instantly gives visitors a personal insight into the coach behind the Mindset Makeover.

Following the hero section is a text-based area dedicated to detailing the webinar. This section methodically explains what the webinar entails, its benefits, and how it aligns with Alex's approach to personal development.

The page concludes with a "Learn More about Webinar" button. This direct call-to-action is strategically placed to encourage visitors to explore further and potentially sign up for the webinar. The section ends with a "Learn More about Webinar" button, inviting visitors to discover more about the webinar offering.

![About Page](./docs/page-about.jpg "about Page")

### Contact Page

In the Mindset Makeover project, the Contact page is straightforward, featuring a brief intro and a simple contact form for easy communication.

![Contact Page](./docs/page-contact.jpg "Contact Page")

### Thank you pages

I created three different thank you pages tailored to specific actions: contact form submission, newsletter signup, and webinar signup. Each page provides a customized thank you message relevant to the action taken, ensuring a personalized and appreciative response for every form submission.

![Thank You Pages](./docs/page-thank-you.jpg "Thank You Pages")

### 404 Page

In the Mindset Makeover project, I created a custom 404 page with a fun twist. Using a brain illustration generated by DALL-E and edited in Photoshop, the page features a playful error message and a link to return to the home page, ensuring visitors can easily navigate back.

![404 Page](./docs/page-404.jpg "404 Page")

### Legal Pages

I also included Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions pages with example content. This ensures legal compliance for the site, especially as it collects user data, and allows linking to privacy details directly from forms' consent checkboxes.

![Legal Pages](./docs/page-legal.jpg "Legal Pages")

## Technology used

- **HTML and CSS**: The core of the project, these languages were used to structure and style the website.
- **VSCode**: I chose VSCode as my (IDE) for its efficiency and ease of use.
- **Git and GitHub**: Git was used for version control, allowing me to track and manage changes in the code. The project is hosted on GitHub, from where it's also deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Figma**: A key tool in my design process, Figma was used for creating both mobile and desktop wireframes.
- **ChatGPT and Grammarly**: ChatGPT helped me to brainstorm, create and refine the website's content, while Grammarly ensured the content was clear and plagiarism-free.
- **DALL-E and Midjourney**: I have used DALL-E to brainstorm logo ideas while Midjourney was used for imaginative photos of Alex and other website imagery.
- **Procreate and Adobe Illustrator**: The icons for the site were initially drawn in Procreate and then vectorized in Illustrator, ensuring high-quality and scalable graphics.
- **Adobe Photoshop**: This was my go-to tool for editing and optimizing the generated graphics, and for exporting image files in the appropriate formats for web use.

ChatGPT was not used to generate a single line of code

## Issues

1. **Navigation Functionality**
- **Problem:** Initially, I used the `has()` CSS selector to trigger the opening of the mobile navigation when the menu button was clicked. However, this approach presented an issue when it came to CSS validation. The `has()` selector did not comply with CSS validation standards, and finding a suitable solution proved challenging at the time.
- **Solution:** To resolve this issue, I undertook a refactor of the header, using the solution implemented in the Love Running project. This new approach ensured proper navigation functionality while passing the CSS validation.      

2. **Image Masking**
- **Problem:** Originally, I used CSS masking techniques to apply SVG blob shapes to images. However, this approach led to validation warnings, primarily due to the usage of -webkit prefixes.
- **Solution:** To fix these issues, I decided to abandon the use of -webkit prefixes. I used the blob shapes in Photoshop to mask images and exported them as webp files with transparent backgrounds. This alternative approach achieved the same visual results while reducing the complexity of the code and clearing the warnings.

3. **Icon Handling**
- **Issue:** Using CSS masks with SVG images for icon colour switching led to warnings due to -webkit prefixes similar to the issues encountered with the image blobs.
- **Solution:** I replaced CSS masks with inline SVGs. This change cleared the warnings and simplified the CSS, resulting in a cleaner and more compliant codebase.

## Testing and Validation

Website was tested manually using chrome developer tools breakpoints but also with physical devicaes like laptop tablet and a smartphone.

I have checked all links correctly in the main navigation, secondary links and other links in text and forms.
