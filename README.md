# Mindset Makeover Website - CI Project 1

**Mindset Makeover** is a made-up personal coaching website. It's part of a project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development. The main character of this project is Alex Richards. He's like a personal coach. His life story is full of challenges. But he chose to change his life. He did this by transforming how he thinks and deals with problems. This significant change helped him a lot. So, he started Mindset Makeover. This website is for assisting people to change their life stories like he did.

## Planning

### Project Scope and Objectives

Mindset Makeover is a personal coaching website. I have designed it to be simple and user-friendly. This project includes a home page, a place for signing up for newsletters, information about webinars, and a form to register for these webinars. There's also a contact page for questions or support.

#### Mindset Makeover Website Objectives

1. **Educational Engagement**: I aim to provide content that helps visitors understand the importance of a positive mindset in their personal and professional lives.
2. **User Interaction**: I aim to engage users by offering newsletter sign-ups and webinar registrations, providing practical advice and inspiring stories.
3. **Brand Awareness**: I'm focusing on establishing Mindset Makeover as a known resource for personal development. Community building is beyond this project's scope, but I might add this later.
4. **User Conversion**: I want to encourage visitors to participate actively, especially in the free webinars Alex Richards hosts, where they can learn about positive thinking and self-empowerment.

#### Key components of the website include:

- **Home page**: Introduces the mission of Mindset Makeover.
- **About page**: Detailing Alex Richards’ journey and the philosophy behind Mindset Makeover.
- **Webinar registration page**: Details about the upcoming webinar and a place for users to sign up for webinars.
- **Contact page**: For user inquiries and support.

In the future, I might add a blog, a podcast, and other elements to the website. For now, my focus is on offering a streamlined and valuable experience.

The ultimate purpose of the website is to not only deliver information but also to inspire users to take steps towards enhancing their lives. The project will focus on delivering a seamless user experience with high-quality content, thereby fostering a positive community and brand loyalty.

### Wireframes
Creating wireframes was crucial for developing Mindset Makeover. I chose Figma for this task because it's user-friendly and practical. I used real text instead of placeholders in the wireframes, making them more detailed and reflective of the final site.

**Key Aspects of Wireframing**:

- **Layout Visualization**: Using Figma, I was able to quickly visualize the site's layout, ensuring it was easy to navigate.
- **Responsive Design**: I made wireframes for both desktop and mobile devices to guarantee a good user experience on any screen.
- **Real Content Integration**: Including real text in the wireframes gave me a clearer view of the final look and functionality of the site.

Figma was a great help in streamlining my design process, allowing me to focus on the user experience right from the start.

## Design
### Colors Scheme
In the design of the Mindset Makeover website, I carefully selected a colour palette of red, blue, and neutral grey to enhance the user experience and visual appeal.

**Red**, as the primary color, is strategically used for main call-to-action buttons, links, and icons. It also serves as a background for testimonials, breaking the visual monotony and drawing attention. This vibrant colour symbolizes energy and action, aligning with the site's objective of motivating personal growth.


**Blue** is utilized for headings, darker background elements, and secondary buttons. Its calm and stable nature complements the red, providing a sense of tranquillity and trust, essential for a personal development website.

Additionally, **neutral grey** plays a subtle but crucial role. It is used for very light backgrounds, offering a clean, modern look that enhances readability. For the copyright section, a darker shade of grey provides a sophisticated contrast, grounding the site's design.

Together, these colours create a balanced and engaging visual experience. The combination of red and blue aligns with the website's core themes, while the grey adds a necessary balance, ensuring the design remains accessible and pleasing to the eye.
