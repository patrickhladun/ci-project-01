# Mindset Makeover Website - CI Project 1

**Mindset Makeover** is a made-up personal coaching website. It's part of a project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development. The main character of this project is Alex Richards. He's like a personal coach. His life story is full of challenges. But he chose to change his life. He did this by transforming how he thinks and deals with problems. This significant change helped him a lot. So, he started Mindset Makeover. This website is for assisting people to change their life stories like he did.

## Planning
### Project Scope and Objectives

#### Skeleton

### Wireframes
Creating wireframes was crucial for developing Mindset Makeover. I chose Figma for this task because it's user-friendly and practical. I used real text instead of placeholders in the wireframes, making them more detailed and reflective of the final site.

**Key Aspects of Wireframing**:

- **Layout Visualization**: Using Figma, I was able to quickly visualize the site's layout, ensuring it was easy to navigate.
- **Responsive Design**: I made wireframes for both desktop and mobile devices to guarantee a good user experience on any screen.
- **Real Content Integration**: Including real text in the wireframes gave me a clearer view of the final look and functionality of the site.

Figma was a great help in streamlining my design process, allowing me to focus on the user experience right from the start.

## Design
### Colors Scheme
In the design of the Mindset Makeover website, I carefully selected a colour palette of red, blue, and neutral grey to enhance the user experience and visual appeal.

**Red**, as the primary color, is strategically used for main call-to-action buttons, links, and icons. It also serves as a background for testimonials, breaking the visual monotony and drawing attention. This vibrant colour symbolizes energy and action, aligning with the site's objective of motivating personal growth.

**Blue** is utilized for headings, darker background elements, and secondary buttons. Its calm and stable nature complements the red, providing a sense of tranquillity and trust, essential for a personal development website.

Additionally, **neutral grey** plays a subtle but crucial role. It is used for very light backgrounds, offering a clean, modern look that enhances readability. For the copyright section, a darker shade of grey provides a sophisticated contrast, grounding the site's design.

Together, these colours create a balanced and engaging visual experience. The combination of red and blue aligns with the website's core themes, while the grey adds a necessary balance, ensuring the design remains accessible and pleasing to the eye.
### Fonts
For this project, I chose the Poppins font. Poppins is a geometric sans-serif font known for its modern and clean appearance. Its sleek lines and readable characters make it a popular choice for digital platforms.

**Why Poppins is a good choice**:

1. **Readability**: Poppins offers excellent readability across different devices and screen sizes, which is crucial for ensuring that the website's content is easily digestible by the audience.
2. **Modern Feel**: The contemporary and uncluttered look of Poppins aligns well with the modern and professional aesthetic of the Mindset Makeover website.
3. **Versatility**: Poppins works well in various contexts, from headings and menus to body text, providing a cohesive visual experience throughout the site.
4. **Friendly Appearance**: Despite its clean geometry, Poppins has a friendly quality that makes the website feel approachable and engaging, aligning with the supportive and motivating nature of Mindset Makeover.

In summary, Poppins not only enhances the website’s visual appeal but also supports its functional and emotional objectives, making it an ideal choice for this project.
### Visuals
#### Logo
I brainstormed the initial design ideas for the logo using Midjourney, which helped generate a range of creative concepts. I then used Adobe Illustrator to refine my favourite concept into the final design. This process allowed me to create a logo that's clear and impactful and truly represents the ethos of the brand.
#### Images
For the specific images needed in the project, like the headshots of Alex Richards, I turned to Midjourney to create the initial versions. These AI-generated images provided a solid starting point. I then used Adobe Photoshop to refine these images further, enhancing their quality to ensure they seamlessly fit the website's overall aesthetic.
#### Icons
I sketched the website's icons by hand on a tablet. I wanted them to have an organic, hand-drawn look to add a unique and personal touch to the site. After completing the sketches, I digitized and vectorized them using Adobe Illustrator. This approach ensured the icons maintained their organic aesthetic and remained visually sharp and effective.
