# Mindset Makeover Website - CI Project 1

**Mindset Makeover** is a fictional personal coaching website envisioned as a part of a project one of Code Institute Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development. At the heart of this project is Alex Richards, a persona created to embody the spirit of a personal coach whose journey is both inspiring and relatable. Alex's life has been far from straightforward. Faced with numerous challenges, he made a pivotal decision to rewrite his life story by changing his mindset and approach towards life's obstacles. This transformative journey led him to establish Mindset Makeover – a platform dedicated to helping others rewrite their narratives.

## User Experience

### Wireframes

In the development process of the Mindset Makeover website, wireframes played a crucial role. I chose to use Figma, a versatile and user-friendly tool, for creating these wireframes. The decision to use real text instead of placeholder text or 'lorem ipsum' gave a more accurate representation of how the content would look and interact on the website.

**Key Aspects of Wireframing**:

- **Layout Visualization**: Figma enabled quick and efficient layout planning, ensuring a user-friendly design for all pages.
- **Responsive Design**: By creating wireframes for both mobile and desktop, I ensured the website's responsiveness and adaptability.
- **Real Content Integration**: Using actual text content provided a more accurate depiction of the final design, aiding in spacing, typography, and overall visual balance.

Using Figma for wireframing helped streamline the design process, making it more efficient and aligned with the project's goals. It provided a clear pathway from conceptualization to the final design, ensuring that every aspect of the user experience was carefully considered from the outset.
